# Exploring Ubuntu Home Lab

---

Before beginning:
- Ran 'sudo apt update' to refresh my packacge index and show my system which packages could be updated.
- Ran 'sudo apt upgrade' to install any updates my system needed.
- Ran 'sudo reboot' to guarantee the system applied all updates consistently.

Lab:
